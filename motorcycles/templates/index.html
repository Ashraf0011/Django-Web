          Motorcycle is one of the enjoyable transport midium this days. The first
          ever motorcycle was designed and built by the <strong>German inventors Gottlieb
          Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt, <b>Germany in 1885</b></strong>. In 1894,
          Hildebrand & Wolfm√ºller became the first series production motorcycle,
          At the turn of the 19th century the first major mass-production firms
          were set up. In 1898, <strong><i>Triumph Motorcycles</i></strong> in England began
          producing motorbikes, and by 1903 it was producing over 500 bikes.
          Other British firms were Royal Enfield, Norton and Birmingham Small Arms
          Company who began motorbike production in 1899, 1902 and 1910, respectively.
          <strong><em>During the First World War,</em> </strong> motorbike production was greatly
          ramped up for the war.American company Harley-Davidson
          was devoting over 50% of its factory output toward military contract
          by the end of the war. The British company Triumph Motorcycles sold more
          than 30,000 of its Triumph Type H model to allied forces during the war.
          With the rear wheel driven by a belt, the Model H was fitted with a 499 cc
          (30.5 cu in) air-cooled four-stroke single-cylinder engine.
          It was also the first Triumph without pedals.
